Hoping for a fresh start for her son, his mother decides to move their family out of town. However, when his childhood friend Kel re-enters his life, Sunny finds himself thrust back into a world he once knew. With only three days before the move, the duo come across familiar faces as they go through town - reawakening a dark past that Sunny has tried so hard to forget.",
